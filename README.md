# Artemis-Financial-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report
<h3><b>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?</b></h3>
<p>In this exercise, I work on the Agile Scrum Team at the company, Global Rain. The client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial believes in secure coding practices.

Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface. They are seeking Global Rain’s expertise about how to protect their client data and financial information.

Specifically, Artemis Financial wants to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. When the web application is used to transfer data, they will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum. You must take their current software application and add secure communication mechanisms to meet their software security requirements. You’ll deliver a production quality integrated application that includes secure coding protocols.</p>

<h3><b>What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?</b></h3>
<p>I added an algorithm that encrypts all information sent and makes it nearly impossible to see the information being transferred unless the receiver has a way to decrypt the message. I used a vulnerability report to find issues with the plugins and dependencies that were present in the code. I then began a suppression file to remove the false positives. Software security should be the number one priority of any company, as applications are the only way that some customers will ever interact with a company. Websites and applications hold some of the most secure information for their customers... not protecting this information would be reckless. Having secure software makes your customer feel safe and allows them to do business with your company.</p>
<h3><b>What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?</b></h3>
<p>The hardest [art of the vulnerability assessment was learning to understand what all of the information that is present in the report, after that, it is extremely simple and straightforward to understand the report!</p>
<h3><b>How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?</b></h3>
<p>I added the Algorithm Cipher, <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>, as this will increase the security of the overall application. It is good to use the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>. This website can allow you to check for vulnerabilites, but there is another website that is really good for vulnerability reports. <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/">The Maven Repository</a> is for Maven dependencies and can be used to look at a number of factors about dependencies! I recommend checking them out.</p>
<h3><b>How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</b></h3>
<p>The only way to truly know if the application is functional and secure is to test it! My certificate was invalid, and I believe that it may not be possible to make it secure.. But if this were deployed on a website, I would have a certificate from a Trusted Certificate Authority, and it would be 100% secure. To be sure that you do not introduce new vulnerabilities, it is best to run a vulnerability scan on the material and make sure that no new vulnerabilities are reported.</p>
<h3><b>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?</b></h3>
<p>Secure coding practices, <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>, and <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/">The Maven Repository</a>.</p>
<h3><b>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?</b></h3>
<p>From this assignment, they will be able to see correctly demonstrated vulnerability reporting, false-positive reduction, and ability to add Hashing Algorithms using their documentation.</p>
<h3><b>Thank you so much for reading this and looking over my report!
